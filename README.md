# The Restaurant Industry in the United States Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic
This project examines and analyses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We used two data sets from the OpenTable API showing a year-over-year comparison of the number of seated diners and an additional dataset from The New York Times with the number of daily COVID-19 cases by state. 

## Installation 
This project did not require any extra libraries and was written using Python 3.7.6.

To view this project, first clone the repository on your device using the command below:

```git clone https://github.com/manuelarod/restaurant-industry-amidst-covid19.git```

## Project Motivation
Undoubtedly, the restaurant industry has been highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. By this point, we've all found out at least one restaurant we used to go to has closed or is struggling to survive. As cities and states start to reopen across the US I wanted to get a grasp of the state of the industry and a more quantitative view of the impact of the pandemic and the prospect of the recovery. The data made available by OpenTable perfectly served this purpose as it provides an insightful view of the state of the industry. 

## File Descriptions
This repository includes a jupyter notebook file with all the code and analysis, as well as the .csv files of the data sets used in the project. 

## Objectives and methods
The objective of the project is to provide restaurant owners and stakeholders with a clear and detailed view of the state of the industry and its recovery since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. We used descriptive analytics and data visualization techniques to analyze how the behavior of the virus and the policies implemented across different states have affected the industry's recovery. Throughout the process of data exploration and visualization we experimented with different kinds of plots and techniques to find the that conveyed compelling and insightful answers to our questions; for this reason we decided to work with a limited number of states.
